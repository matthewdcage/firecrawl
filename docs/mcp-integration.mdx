# Firecrawl MCP Integration

## Overview
The Firecrawl MCP (Model Control Protocol) integration allows seamless interaction with Firecrawl's capabilities directly from Cursor IDE. This integration enables real-time analysis of web content and direct interaction with Ollama models.

## Server Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- Ollama installed and running
- Cursor IDE with MCP support

### Configuration
The server runs on `http://localhost:3456` by default. You can configure the port using the `FIRECRAWL_OLLAMA_PORT` environment variable.

## Available Tools

### analyze_url
Analyzes a webpage using Firecrawl and Ollama.

Parameters:
- `url` (string, required): The URL to analyze
- `model` (string, optional): Ollama model to use

### analyze_with_ollama
Analyzes content directly with Ollama.

Parameters:
- `content` (string, required): The content to analyze
- `model` (string, optional): Ollama model to use
- `temperature` (number, optional): Temperature for generation

### list_models
Lists available Ollama models.

## Known Issues

1. SSE Connection Handling
   - Multiple connections may be created for the same client
   - Connection cleanup needs improvement

2. Host Binding
   - Inconsistencies between localhost and 127.0.0.1
   - Need to standardize host binding across the application

3. Tools Display
   - Tools may not appear immediately in Cursor
   - Format validation issues with tool responses

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
If you encounter connection issues:
1. Ensure the server is running on the correct port
2. Check if Ollama is running and accessible
3. Verify no other service is using port 3456

### Tool Visibility
If tools are not visible in Cursor:
1. Restart the MCP server
2. Refresh the Cursor connection
3. Check server logs for any error messages

## Development Status
This integration is currently in development. Key areas of focus:
- Improving connection stability
- Enhancing tool response format
- Adding more robust error handling
- Implementing proper connection lifecycle management
